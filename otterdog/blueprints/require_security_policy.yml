  This blueprint will create a PR that will add a default SECURITY.md file to the `.github` repo of your GitHub organization if it does not yet exist.
  You can adjust the PR as needed to fit it to your needs. If a repo defines a more specific SECURITY.md file it will take precedence of the one present in the `.github` repo.

        # Security Policy
        This Eclipse Foundation Project adheres to the [Eclipse Foundation Vulnerability Reporting Policy](https://www.eclipse.org/security/policy/).
        
        ## How To Report a Vulnerability
        
        If you think you have found a vulnerability in this repository, please report it to us through coordinated disclosure.
        
        **Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public issues, discussions, or change requests.**
        
        Instead, you can report it using one of the following ways:
        
        * Contact the [Eclipse Foundation Security Team](mailto:security@eclipse-foundation.org) via email
        * Create a [confidential issue](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/security/vulnerability-reports/-/issues/new?issuable_template=new_vulnerability) in the Eclipse Foundation Vulnerability Reporting Tracker
        * [Optional] Report a [vulnerability](https://github.com/<organization>/<repository>/security/advisories/new) directly via private vulnerability reporting on GitHub
        
        You can find more information about reporting and disclosure at the [Eclipse Foundation Security page](https://www.eclipse.org/security/).
