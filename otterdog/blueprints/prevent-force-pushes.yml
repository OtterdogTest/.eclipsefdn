name: Prevent force-pushes on the default branch of any repository
description: |-
  This blueprint will create a PR that will amend the configuration in the `.eclipsefdn` repo to disallow force-pushes for the default branch of any repo.
  
  If you would like to exclude some repos and still allow force pushes for them, add a comment to the PR with the repo names.

  condition: $count($.rulesets[allows_force_pushes = false and "~DEFAULT_BRANCH" in include_refs and "~ALL" in include_repo_names and target = "branch"]) > 0
